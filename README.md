Factor analysis is a statistical method used to identify and understand the relationships between a group of variables. The main purpose of factor analysis is to identify the underlying factors arising from patterns of correlation between these variables. The common steps in conducting factor analysis are as follows:

1. Determine the research objectives: The first step in factor analysis is to establish the research objectives. We need to understand what we want to know or clarify through factor analysis. The primary purpose of factor analysis is to uncover the underlying structure within the data by identifying factors that underlie variability in the data. Therefore, factor analysis can help uncover hidden structures in the data and provide valuable insights for decision-making.

2. Collect data: Next, we need to gather relevant data for factor analysis. This data can come from surveys, observational data, or other sources that align with our research objectives.

3. Determine the number of factors: After collecting data, we need to determine the number of factors to extract. This can be done using methods such as Kaiser's Rule or scree plots.

4. Evaluate model fit: Subsequently, we need to evaluate the fit of the factor model we have extracted. The commonly used method for this is principal component analysis, where we calculate communalities, eigenvalues, and the variance explained by each factor.

5. Interpret factors: Once we have confirmed a good factor model, we need to interpret the extracted factors. This involves looking at factor loadings and understanding the meaning behind each factor.

6. Make interpretations and report: The final step is to interpret the results of the factor analysis and compile a research report summarizing our findings.
